# Rotating 3D
## Math
This project is all about math.<br>
<b>Triangles?</b> - geometry, so math.<br>
<b>A cube?</b> - mathematical solid.<br>
<b>Projection of 3 dimensional solids on to xy-plane?</b> - a lot of math.<br>
<b>Rotation of vectors using 3D rotation matrix?</b> - even more math (if that's even possible).<br>
<br>
## Explanation
So yeah... Programming is really just math. Don't believe when anyone says otherwise.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's what this repository is about. Projecting 3D solids on to 2D plane. Also using 3D rotation matrix to show that it actually is 3 dimensional (still a projection).<br>
<br>
The project is written in C++/SDL2.
## What can you do with it?
Everything you want! Feel free to use it. I'd even be honored if someone would. Have fun!
